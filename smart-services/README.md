# Smart-Services
Smart-Services are the bread and butter of SEPIA. After SEPIA has recognized the user-intent (e.g. how is the weather?) a Smart-Service will manage the dialog to get missing information (e.g. location), fulfill the request (e.g. call a third-party API) and build the result for the SEPIA client (e.g. cards for the app).
