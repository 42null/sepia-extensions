# Mesh-Plugins
Mesh-Plugins are extensions for [SEPIA Mesh-Nodes](https://github.com/SEPIA-Framework/sepia-mesh-nodes) that run specific tasks or programs.
Using the Teach-UI included in the [SEPIA cross-platform app](https://github.com/SEPIA-Framework/sepia-html-client-app) you can create your own voice-commands that trigger these plugins.
A popular example is the 'RuntimePlugin' (included by default in a Mesh-Node) that you can use to execute terminal commands, e.g. to run scripts written in other programming languages or simply to shutdown your PC (possibilities are endless) ;-)
